# Design Your API

Start designing your API with guidance from the experts.

## What would you like to design?

You can design:

1. **REST API** - Traditional RESTful API with resource-oriented design
   - Stateless architecture
   - HTTP methods and status codes
   - Resource modeling and relationships
   - Pagination and filtering

2. **GraphQL API** - Query language for flexible data fetching
   - Schema design
   - Query optimization
   - Subscription patterns
   - Federation

3. **Hybrid API** - Combine REST and GraphQL
   - REST for public endpoints
   - GraphQL for internal clients
   - API gateway pattern

## Let's Start

Tell Claude Code what you're building:
- What domain? (e.g., e-commerce, social network, SaaS)
- Expected scale? (users, requests per second)
- Main resources? (users, posts, products)
- Special requirements? (real-time, streaming, offline)

Then Claude Code will:
- ✅ Recommend architecture
- ✅ Design resource models
- ✅ Suggest security approach
- ✅ Outline performance optimizations
- ✅ Provide implementation guidance

## Next Steps

1. Use `/review` to validate your design
2. Use `/security-check` to audit security
3. Use `/performance-guide` to optimize
