## Example: Building an Order Processing API

```
1. /architect
   Input: "Order processing system, 10k DAU, need plugin support for payment"
   Output: Complete architecture with 7 agent perspectives

2. Review each agent's guidance:
   - API Architect: REST endpoints, contracts
   - Backend: Node.js + TypeScript patterns
   - Database: Order storage optimization
   - DevOps: Docker/K8s deployment
   - Security: PCI DSS compliance
   - Frontend: React client for order creation
   - Scaling: Event-driven order processing

3. /roadmap
   Output: Week-by-week implementation plan

4. /audit
   Input: Your initial API design
   Output: Issues and improvements

5. /secure
   Input: Your security approach
   Output: Hardening recommendations

6. Build with confidence!
```
