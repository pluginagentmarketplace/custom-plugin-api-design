# API Architecture Skill

## Quick Start

Master API design across three major paradigms.

### REST API (Traditional)
- Resource-oriented design
- HTTP status codes and methods
- Stateless communication
- Easy to understand and implement
- Best for: Simple CRUD operations, mobile apps, public APIs

### GraphQL (Modern)
- Query language for APIs
- Client specifies exact data needed
- Single endpoint
- Powerful for complex queries
- Best for: Complex data requirements, frontend-heavy apps, internal APIs

### Hybrid (Recommended)
- REST for public/simple operations
- GraphQL for internal/complex operations
- Leverage strengths of both
